Animal Shelter Data Analysis Dashboard

This project features an interactive data visualization dashboard built using Dash and Plotly, which provides insights into the operations of an animal shelter. The dashboard analyzes data related to animals brought into the shelter, focusing on metrics like intake rates, average days spent in the shelter, adoption rates, and various animal characteristics.

Key Features:
Cards Overview: Displays key statistics such as:

Daily number of animals received at the shelter.

Average number of days spent in the shelter by animals.

Adoption rate of animals in the shelter.

Interactive Visuals:

Pie Chart: Visualizes the distribution of animal types received at the shelter.

Bar Chart: This shows the outcome type (e.g., adoption, return to owner) of animals.

Scatter Plot: Displays the relationship between animal age and time spent in the shelter.

Technologies Used:
Python for backend processing and data analysis.

Dash and Plotly are used to create interactive, web-based visualizations.

Pandas for data processing and manipulation.

Bootstrap for responsive layout and styling.

This project offers valuable insights into shelter operations and can be useful for decision-making, resource allocation, and operational improvements in animal shelters.
